# MCP Contract Analysis

This document analyzes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) contract, protocol design, and compliance requirements.

## Protocol Overview
- **MCP** defines a standard for tool/plugin discovery, invocation, and context management.
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** is used for tool invocation.
- **Tool Manifest** is dynamically generated from plugin CLI help output.

## Compliance Requirements
- Plugins must:
  - Provide a CLI with subcommands and help text
  - Follow naming conventions (`plugin.command`)
  - Return structured output
- The server must:
  - Expose `/tools/manifest` and `/rpc` endpoints
  - Manage sessions securely
  - Log all tool invocations

## Security and Auditing
- All invocations are logged
- Session management is enforced
- Plugins are sandboxed via subprocesses
