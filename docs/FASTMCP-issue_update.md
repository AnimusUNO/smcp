## UPDATE: Root Cause Identified - FastMCP Limitation, Not Letta Issue

### Key Findings from Investigation

After extensive testing and analysis, we've identified that **the issue is with FastMCP's SSE implementation, not Letta's client**.

### What We Discovered

1. **FastMCP's SSE Implementation is Unidirectional**
   - FastMCP only supports server→client streaming via GET requests
   - It does NOT support bidirectional communication over SSE
   - This violates the MCP SSE specification

2. **Letta's SSE Client is Correctly Implemented**
   - Letta properly uses the official MCP library's `sse_client`
   - It correctly expects bidirectional SSE communication
   - The client implementation follows MCP specification

3. **Successful Solution: Base MCP Library**
   - Switched from FastMCP to base `mcp.server.Server` and `mcp.server.sse.SseServerTransport`
   - This provides proper bidirectional SSE support
   - Letta now works perfectly with our MCP server

### Technical Details

**FastMCP Problem:**
```python
# FastMCP - Unidirectional only
server = FastMCP()
app = server.sse_app()  # Only supports GET /sse
```

**Correct Implementation:**
```python
# Base MCP Library - Bidirectional
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.sse import SseServerTransport

server = Server(name="smcp", version="1.0.0")
sse_transport = SseServerTransport("/messages/")
# Properly handles both GET /sse and POST /messages/
```

### Resolution

- ✅ **Letta client works correctly** with proper MCP SSE servers
- ✅ **FastMCP has SSE implementation limitations** that need to be addressed
- ✅ **Base MCP library provides correct SSE implementation**

### Recommendation

**No action required on Letta's side.** The issue should be reported to FastMCP maintainers regarding their SSE transport implementation.

### Test Results

Our MCP server now works perfectly with Letta:
- ✅ Proper SSE connection establishment
- ✅ Bidirectional communication
- ✅ Tool discovery and execution
- ✅ Full compatibility with Letta's SSE client

**Status: RESOLVED - Issue was with FastMCP, not Letta**
